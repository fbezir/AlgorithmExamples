Step 1 - Start
Step 2 - Get number1, number2 and number3 from the user
Step 3 - If number1 > number2 && number1 > number3
	 print (number1 is maximum)
Step 4 - If number1 < number2 && number1 < number3
	 	If numberi2 > numberi3
	 	Write (number2 is maximum)
Step 5 - Otherwise 
	 write (number3 is maximum)
Step 6 - Exit

Step 1 - Start
Step 2 - Get number1, number2 and number3 from the user
Step 3 - Set number1 is the largest
Step 4 - If number2 > number1 && number2 > number3 then number2 is the largest
Step 5 - If number3 > number1 && number3 > number2 then number3 is the largest
