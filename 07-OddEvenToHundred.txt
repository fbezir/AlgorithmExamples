Question: Algorithm that writes numbers from 1 to 100 as odd and even

(i.e. : 1 odd, 2 even, ... 100 odd)

Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : counter = 1
Step 3 : Loop over (counter <= 100)
		If counter % 2 = 0
		  Print to Screen (counter + double)
		If not 
		  Print to Screen (counter + odd)
		sayay = sayac + 1
Step 4: Finish
