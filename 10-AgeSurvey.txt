Question: Algorithm that finds the average weight of students on a campus by gender?

Step 1   : Start
Step 2   : maleNumber = 0, femaleNumber = 0, maleWeight = 0, femaleWeight = 0, maleMid = 0, 	   femaleMid = 0
Step 3   : Are there any students, is there any information?
		a. If yes, go to step 4
		b. If no, skip to step 8
Step 4   : What is your gender?
Step 4.1 : Read genderValue (m/f)
Step 5   : What is your weight?
Step 5.1 : Read weightValue
Step 6   : If gender = "e"
		maleNumber += 1
		maleWeight += weightValue
Step 7   : If not (i.e. gender = "k")
		number of women += 1
		womanWeight += weightValue
Step 8   : maleMid = male weight/maleNumber
	   womanMid = womanWeight/WomanNumber
Step 9   : Write the values to the screen (maleNumber, femaleNumber, maleWeight, femaleWeight,    	   maleMid, femaleMid)
Step 10  : Finish
