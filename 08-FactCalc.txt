Question: Algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number received from the user and prints it to the screen 


Step 1	: Start
Step 2	: Take input from the user for the number to calculate its factorial.
Step 3	: Check if the input number is less than 0. If it is, return an error or an a	  	  ppropriate message indicating that the factorial is not defined for negative numbers 	  and go back to the Step2
Step 4 	: If the input number is 0 or 1, the factorial is defined as 1. Go to Step 9.
Step 5 	: Set variables counter to 1 and factorial to 1.
Step 6 	: If counter is less than or equal to the input number, go to step 7 otherwise go to 	  Step 9.	
Step 7 	: Let factorial = counter * factorial and go to Step 8.
Step 8 	: Increment counter by 1 and go to step 6.
Step 9	: Print the value of factorial.
Step 10	: Exit
