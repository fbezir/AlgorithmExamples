Question: Algorithm that calculates the student's grade and writes pass or fail
Cond: Midterm: 30%, Final: 70%, passing grade: 50
Note: Grades will be calculated out of 100

Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Get midterm grade and final grade values from the user.
Step 3 : If 0 <= midGrade < 100 && 0 <= finalGrade < 100, go to step 4, if not, go to step 2
Step 4 : passGrade = midGrade * 0.3 + finalGrade * 0.7
Step 5 : passLimit = 50
Step 6 : If the passGrade < passLimit 
		Print on Screen ("You failed because your average grade was less than 50")
	  If not
		Print on Screen ("You passed because your average grade was higher than 50") 
Step 7 : Exit
