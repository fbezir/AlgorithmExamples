Question: Write the algorithm that finds the average of n numbers received from the user


Step 1: Start
Step 2: total = 0, average = 0
Step 2.1: Print to the screen ("How many numbers do you want to enter?: ")
Step 3: Read and assign to variable (i.e. n=6)
Step 4 : Set the  counter = 1
Step 5 : if counter <= n go to Step 5-a otherwise go to Step 5-e
		a. Print to screen (Enter number please... : _)
		a.1. Read and assign to variable number = value
		b. total = total + number
		c. counter  = counter + 1
		d. Go back Step 5 
		e. average = total / n
Step 6: Print on the screen (Your average: average)
Step 7: Exit
